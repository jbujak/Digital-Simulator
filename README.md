# Digital-Simulator
Minecraft inspired simulator of digital circuits

Minecraft is a great platform for creating digital circuits, but it has some disadvantages.
The problem is that it generates huge delays on each element and it does not have built-in simple logical circuits,
such as gates and memory cells. I decided to write my own minecraft copy, which has almost none delay and provides 
user with some blocks useful for building digital ciruits.
