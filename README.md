# Digital-Simulator
Minecraft inspired simulator of digital circuits

Minecraft is a great platform for creating digital circuits, but it has some disadvantages.
The problem is that it generates huge delays on each element and it does not have built-in simple logical circuits,
such as gates and memory cells. I decided to write my own minecraft copy, which has almost none delay and provides 
user with some blocks useful for building digital ciruits.

Currently user cannot choose name for his save. To load example save one should copy it to the folder where application
is located and change its name to world.sav.
